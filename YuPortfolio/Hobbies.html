        <li>Football</li>
        <div class="bulletText">
        <p>Football is the one big sport that I like to particapate in. Even though I'm no the best on the team, I still show up to practices and put in the most effort I can put in to try and help the team out.</p>
        </div>
        <li>Gaming</li>
        <div class="bulletText">
        <p>When I say gaming, I'm mostly referring to Esports. I am a part of the East High Esports team, which started up only this year, and I play Super Smash Bros Ultimate (SSBU). I may enjoy putting lots of time and effort into gaming, but when it comes to other things like work or school stuff, I always make sure to put the effort in that stuff first before even thinking about gaming. If you wish to know more about SSBU, <a href="http://smashbros.com/en_US/index.html">click here</a>.</p>    
        </div>
        <li>Band</li>
        <div class="bulletText">
        <p>Band is something I enjoy doing a lot while I have been school. I play the Euphonium in concert band, Baritone in marching band and the trumpet in jazz band. I have done band since middle school year and plan to hopefully continue after highschool.</p>
