    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
        I'm 17 years old and I suck at life. That be no cap babyyyyy!!
        I also have take a couple computer classes at the Waterloo Career Center.
        They have a great learning envrioment. I also like to do online gaming like 
        Rainbow six seige, Apex Legends, and more games like that. I can be a very easy going person
        but I also can get angry quick and have a lot of attitude. There's not
        much else to know about me. I'm nothing special. 
    </p>
