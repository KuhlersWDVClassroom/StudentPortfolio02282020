    <img src="images/code.jpg" alt="code" class="topimage" id="code">
    <p>I have a little bit of experience in programming before I got into Intro to Web Development at the career center
        I mainly have experience in HTML and CSS and now that I know some of that it is coming back to me during class and 
        now I can begin to work on and perfect the way I code and perfect the way that it is used in the real world. Making
        my code easier to read and way more efficient.
